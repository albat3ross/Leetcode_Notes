# 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).  
Find the minimum element.  
The array may contain duplicates.
Example:
```
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```
## Thoughts
It seems like exactly the same thing from last problem.
Except for one edge case:  
    mid == right/left

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.length-1;
        while (l < r){
            int mid = (l+r)/2;
            
            if (mid > 0 && nums[mid-1] > nums[mid]) 
                return nums[mid]; 
            
            if (nums[mid] > nums[r])        
                l = mid+1;
            else if (nums[mid] < nums[r]) 
                r = mid-1;
            else r--;
            
            
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
}
```
