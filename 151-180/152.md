# 152. Maximum Product Subarray ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.  
Example:
```
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```
## Thoughts
It's a O(n) question, but the problem is how to make it O(n).

## Process of sovling
There're 2 possible trendings in results:
    - meet new number and grow larger in absolute value
    - meet 0 and becomes 0
So all we need to do is to keep tracking of the largest and smallest product.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0, min = 0, boo = -1;
        for (int i : nums){
            if (boo == -1){
                boo = 0;
                res = i; max = i; min = i;
                continue;
            }
            int newmax = (i<0)? min*i:max*i;
            int newmin = (i<0)? max*i:min*i;
            min = Math.min(newmin,i);
            max = Math.max(newmax,i);
            res = Math.max(res,max);
        }
        return res;
        
    }
}
```
