# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).  
Find the minimum element.  
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.  
Example:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```
## Thoughts
I'm very sure I have done some question like this before.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.length-1;
        while (l < r){
            int mid = (l+r)/2;
            if (mid > 0 && nums[mid-1] > nums[mid]) return nums[mid]; 
            if (nums[mid] < nums[r]) 
                r = mid-1;
            else 
                l = mid+1;
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
}
```
