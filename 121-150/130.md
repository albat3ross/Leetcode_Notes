# 130. Surrounded Regions ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.  
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.  
Example:
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running your function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
Explanation:  
Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.  


## Thoughts
Traditional game questions, read rules first, and concluded:
1. All 0s on edge and 0s connected with them are alive, the rest should be turned into X
2. As the special property of corner, all elements in corner are always unchangable and will not affect any other elements
3. The real operation area exist at places not touching the edge


## Process of solving
1. Check all edges except corners. If found 0, extend and mark all connected 0s
2. turn the 0s without mark into X
3. Write code


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean[][] keep;
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        if (board.length == 0) return;
        int row = board.length, col = board[0].length;
        keep = new boolean[row][col];
        
        for (int i = 1; i< row-1; i++){
            if (board[i][0]=='O')       trace(i,0,board);
            if (board[i][col-1]=='O')   trace(i,col-1,board);
        }
        for (int j = 1; j< col-1; j++){
            if (board[0][j]=='O')       trace(0,j,board);
            if (board[row-1][j]=='O')   trace(row-1,j,board);
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < row-1; i++){
            for (int j = 1; j < col-1; j++){
                if (board[i][j]== 'O' && keep[i][j] == false)
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
            }
        }
    }
    public void trace(int i, int j,char[][] board){
        if (board[i][j]!='O'|| keep[i][j]==true) return;
        keep[i][j] = true;
        if (i>0){
            trace(i-1,j,board);
        }
        if (i<board.length-1){
            trace(i+1,j,board);
        }
        if (j>0){
            trace(i,j-1,board);
        }
        if (j<board[0].length-1){
            trace(i,j+1,board);
        }
        
    }
}
```
