# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.  
For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.  
Example 2:
```
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42
```
## Thoughts

A hard question that is not so hard.Analyzing problem and we found it's a NP like road cutting problem, but of couse we wont use NP here, go with recursion.


## Process of solving
1. For each root, while searching for best solution, we have :
   - left/right tree has the best result
   - the best solution went through the root
2. Hence the recursive function need to record 2 thing: first is the largest val under this root which can be used directly as answer, second is the value that can be passed to the parent as reference.
3. write code and debug
4. Make the code looks nice and clean


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        maxPath(root);
        return max;
    }
    public int maxPath(TreeNode root){
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int l = Math.max(maxPath(root.left),0)ï¼Œr = Math.max(maxPath(root.right),0);
        max = Math.max((l+root.val+r),max);
        return Math.max(l+root.val,r+root.val);
    }
}
```
