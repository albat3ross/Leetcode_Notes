# 141. Linked List Cycle ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Easy-green)
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.  
To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.  

## Thoughts
First thoughts is to record every node, if found duplicate node then return false. However this doesn't meet requirement of O(1) memory.
After carefully analyzing the question I found that~~I'm a noob~~this question should use some innovative ways of solving.
After checking discussion board, I found that the dude on top rank provides an answer using fast slow pointer. As if the loop exists. fast ptr must meet slow ptr at some place, new technique learnt!

## Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
