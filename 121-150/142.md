# 142. Linked List Cycle II ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.  
To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.  
Note: Do not modify the linked list.  
## Thoughts
Same type of question from #141, but here we need to return the start point of the loop.  
As we have found out the double ptr method for the previous problem, we can have multiple ways of solving this.

## Process of solving
Since fast ptr must walk 2x distance of slow ptr, and they meet inside the loop. We denote length of the loop l, length before the loop a, they meet at b after loop starts. Therefore slow ptr have walked a+b, and fast have walked (2a+2b), fast have walked n\*l, or a+b more than slow.  
Then we can save our brains by let a new slow ptr start after they met. After the new slow ptr have walked a, the first slow ptr will walked the rest of the b and back to the start of the loop, so they will met at a, return where they meet.


## Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if (slow == fast){
                ListNode slow2 = head;
                while (slow2!= slow){
                    slow2 = slow2.next;
                    slow = slow.next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
