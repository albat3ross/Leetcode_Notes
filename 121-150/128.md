# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.  
Example:
```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
Therefore its length is 4.
```
## Thoughts
Oh it's sort problem, easy pizzy, wait, O(n)?!?!?!?
First thought is to use HashMap or something try to search them up, soon find out didn't work at all.

## Process of solving
1. Make a HashSet to store every potential start of the longest consecutive sequence, if the number is the start then we shouldn't find number-1 in the set.
2. O(n) complexity, potential improvements exist

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for (int i: nums) numSet.add(i);
        int max = 0;
        for (int i: numSet) if (!numSet.contains(i-1)){
                int streak = 1;
                while (numSet.contains(++i)) streak++;
                max = Math.max(streak,max);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
