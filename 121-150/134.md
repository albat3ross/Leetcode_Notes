 134. Gas Station ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].  
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.  
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.  
Note:  
If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
Example 1:
```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3
```
## Process of solving
Read rules and we get:
1. We only have solution if gas.sum > cost.sum
2. As solutions are unique, we must have most of the gas entries less than corresponding cost entry. We can use the gas entries which is larger than cost as start point candidates.
3. If a candidate is not valid, then only candidates "in front of" it could.
4. Just loop through all of it anyway.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i<gas.length; i++){
            sum += gas[i];
            sum -= cost[i];
        }
        if (sum < 0) return -1;
        for (int i = 0; i<gas.length; i++){
            if (gas[i]<cost[i]) continue;
            if (check(i,gas,cost)) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    public boolean check(int i, int[] gas, int[] cost){
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j<gas.length; j++){
            sum += gas[j] - cost[j];
            if (sum < 0) return false;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j<i; j++){
            sum += gas[j] - cost[j];
            if (sum < 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
