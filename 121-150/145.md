# 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.  
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
## Thoughts
First thought is to push right nodes using in-order way, then we found that the sequence is different from that case. 
Running a few cases with pencil and found out that the answer to postorder is exactly reverse of preorder.
This makes the question much easier to solve, push from left to right then.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public Stack<TreeNode> pool;
    public List<Integer> postorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> res = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        if (root == null) return res;
        pool = new Stack<TreeNode>();
        pool.add(root);
        while(!pool.isEmpty()){
            TreeNode n = pool.pop();
            res.add(0,n.val);
            
            if (n.left!=null) pool.push(n.left);
            if (n.right!=null) pool.push(n.right);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
}
```
