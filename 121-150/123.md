# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.  
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.  
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
Example :
```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
```
## Thoughts
Adding 2 times most constraint made this question a DP question, headache comes again...  
Found a genius solution at discussion board.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[] buy = new int[2+1];
        int[] sell = new int[2+1];
        for (int i = 0;i<2+1;i++) buy[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int p: prices){
            for (int i = 2 ; i > 0; i--){
                sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i],buy[i]+p);
                buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i],sell[i-1]-p);
            }
        }
        return sell[2];
    }
}
```
