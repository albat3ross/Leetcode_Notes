# 143. Reorder List ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,  
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…  
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.  
Example 1:
```
Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
Given 1->2->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.
```
## Thoughts
This one is too tedious as a medium question.
Generally made a mind map, we use double ptr to split the list into 2 lists. Reverse the second list, and zip them up. The 1st list should have more elements than the second, so we need a buffer when split.
A good thing is that the code for split and zip are written for us.


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return;
        
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head.next;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        ListNode head2 = slow.next;
        slow.next = null;
        
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (head2 != null) {
            ListNode temp = head2.next;
            head2.next = prev;
            prev = head2;
            head2 = temp;
        }
        head2 = prev;
        ListNode head1 = head;
        while (head1 != null && head2 != null){
            ListNode n1 = head1.next, n2 = head2.next;
            head2.next = n1;
            head1.next = head2;
            head1 = n1;
            head2 = n2;
        }
    }
}
```
