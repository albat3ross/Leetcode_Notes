# 135. Candy ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
here are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.  
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:  
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?  
Example 1:
```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```
## Thoughts
Very interesting problem, run a few cases and we can found that the rule of distributing candies is basically compressing the crest and the trough. How to decrease the total number of candies while meeting all requirements.

## Process of soloving
While distributing the candies, we should have the following cases:
1. current rating >= prev rating, this one is easy, we only need to do ++ or =1 on that entry
2. else, this needs to be furtherly discussed:
   1. The prev #candy is 1. We need to crease the prev #candy, if the prev is the same case, we need to recursively do the operation till rating goes down. Current #candy will be 1
   2. The prev #candy > 1. Current #candy = 1

It's easy to find that the slope addition can sum all #candies at every end of case 2-1. However, if after summation the left node of the line (highest point) is less than expected largest #candy, we have to make compensation so that the begin of the line should be larger than the followings.
Note that if this loop ends with 2-1 case going on, we need another sum to finish this up.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int len = ratings.length, cur = 1, seq = 0, sum = 1;
        if (len <= 1) return len;
        for (int i = 1; i< len; i++){
            if (ratings[i]>=ratings[i-1]){
                if (seq > 0){
                    sum += seq*(seq+1)/2;
                    sum += (seq>=cur)? seq-cur+1:0;
                    seq = 0;
                    cur = 1;
                }
                cur = (ratings[i]==ratings[i-1])? 1:cur+1;
                sum+=cur;
            }else{
                seq++;
            }
        }
        if (seq > 0){
            sum += seq*(seq+1)/2;
            sum += (seq>=cur)? seq-cur+1:0;
        }
        return sum;
    }
   
}
```
