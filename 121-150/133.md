# 133. Clone Graph ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

## Thoughts
Looks like a easy problem. Things get a little complicated after goes into the problem. This question mainly focus on the waste of calculation while using DFS to scan all the nodes, and the difficulty of tracking new nodes. 

The frist thoughts is to use HashMap<Node,Neighbours>, and re-create a new table according to it. Later I found that we don't even need the recording at step 1, use recursion and thats all.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    Map<Integer,Node> map = new HashMap<Integer,Node>();
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        int val = node.val;
        if (map.containsKey(val)) 
            return map.get(val);
        
        Node copy = new Node(val);
        map.put(val, copy);
        for (Node n : node.neighbors) 
            copy.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(n));
        return copy;
    }
}
```
