# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.  
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.  
## Comment
Basically the same from the last question, the only difference is that the given data type has changed into linked list.
After some investigation I found that whatever you do with the cutting method you will always endup in O(nlogn) complexity. Hence changing to array with transfrom be O(n) and solve with O(n) becoming the best solution ~~Perfect excuse!~~

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedListToBST(ListNode head) {
        ListNode cur = head;
        int cnt = 0;
        while(cur!=null){
            cur = cur.next;
            cnt ++;
        }
        int[] nums = new int[cnt];
        cnt = 0;
        while(head!=null){
            nums[cnt++] = head.val;
            head = head.next;
        }
        return sortedArrayToBST(nums);
    }
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length -1;
        return recBST(nums,l,r);
    }
    
    public TreeNode recBST(int[] nums, int l, int r){
        if (l>r) return null;
        if (l==r) return new TreeNode(nums[l]);
        int mid = (l+r)/2;
        TreeNode res = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        res.left = recBST(nums,l,mid-1);
        res.right = recBST(nums,mid+1,r);
        return res;
    }
}
```
