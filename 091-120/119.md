# 119 Pascal's Triangle II ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Easy-green)
Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.  
Note that the row index starts from 0.
Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```
Follow up:  
Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
## Thougths
Using the solution from #118 could solve it

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        List<Integer> pool = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for (int i = 0; i < rowIndex+1; i++){
            pool = nextpool(pool);
        }
        return pool;
    }
}
```
