# 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Easy-green) 
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.  
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
Example:
```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],  
One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
 ```
## Thoughts
Tried with binary split and magically works, did not really figure out how this logically works but as long as the code works then it doesn't matter ;D ~~No~~


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length -1;
        return recBST(nums,l,r);
    }
    
    public TreeNode recBST(int[] nums, int l, int r){
        if (l>r) return null;
        if (l==r) return new TreeNode(nums[l]);
        int mid = (l+r)/2;
        TreeNode res = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        res.left = recBST(nums,l,mid-1);
        res.right = recBST(nums,mid+1,r);
        return res;
    }
}
```
