# 115. Distinct Subsequences ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.  
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).  
It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.
Example 1:
```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```
## Thoughts
Classic DP, but it is still DP :(
Make a table first, recording each letter in T to the corresponding number of the solutions in S.
E.g. mem[x][3] -> if we only looke at first x letter in T, and first 3 letter in S, then how many solutions do we have.
The recursion goes like: each mem[x][j] will be the sum of mem[x]\[j-1](removing a letter from S) and mem[x-1]\[j-1](remove a letter form S and x). And the second term requires that the xth letter in S is the same as the jth letter in T.
Then we simplify the 2d table and turn it into a 1d array.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int numDistinct(String s, String t) {
        int row = t.length()+1, col = s.length()+1;
        int[] mem = new int[col];
        for(int j = 0; j<col; j++){
            mem[j] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i< row; i++){
            int[] newmem = new int[col];
            for (int j = 1; j < col; j++){
                int rec = (t.charAt(i-1)==s.charAt(j-1))?mem[j-1]:0;
                newmem[j] = newmem[j-1]+ rec;
            }
            mem = newmem;
        }
        return mem[col-1];
        
        
    }
}
```
