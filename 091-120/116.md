# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
Follow up:  
You may only use constant extra space.  
Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.  
Example 1:
```
input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
```
## Thoughts
是另外一种recursive的题目，正常recursive都是bottom up拼上来。这道题目的rec写法得top down写下来，思路对了之后写起来还是很轻松的。
Another type of recursive problem that need to think top down. Easy when the thought is clear.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if(root == null) return null;
        if(root.left!=null) root.left.next = root.right;
        if(root.right!=null && root.next!=null) root.right.next = root.next.left;
        connect(root.left);
        connect(root.right);
        return root;
    }
}
```
