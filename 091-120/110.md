# 110. Balanced Binary Tree ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Easy-green) 
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.  
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as: a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.  
## Thoughts
Similiar question again, I modified the depth method from the previous question and easily get the answer.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return recBalance(root)!=-1;
    }
    public int recBalance(TreeNode root){
        if (root == null) return 0;
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) return 1;
        int l = recBalance(root.left);
        int r = recBalance(root.right);
        int diff = Math.abs(l-r);
        if (l==-1 || r==-1) diff = 2;
        return (diff>1)?-1:Math.max(l,r)+1;
    }
}
```
