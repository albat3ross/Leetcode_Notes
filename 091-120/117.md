# 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a binary tree. Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
Follow up:  
You may only use constant extra space.  
Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.  
Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
```
## Thoughts
Mutant from #116, needs another recursion on finding next to make sure the gap is skipped.
Another problem is that the recursion should proceed from right to left as starting from left will make the right part unprepared for search.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if(root == null) return null;
        if(root.left!=null)
            root.left.next = (root.right!= null) ? root.right : findNext(root.next);
        if(root.right!=null) 
            root.right.next = findNext(root.next);
        connect(root.right); // <----- right first
        connect(root.left);
        return root;
    }
    
    public Node findNext(Node root){
        if (root == null) return null;
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null){
            return findNext(root.next);
        }else{
            return (root.left != null) ? root.left : root.right;
        }
    }
}
```
