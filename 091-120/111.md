# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Easy-green) 
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.  
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.  
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
## Thoughts
Not much to say, something confusing is that the time taken for DFS and BFS on this problem are basically the same. Might because of the test case is too small in terms of size. 

## Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null) return 1;
        int l = minDepth(root.left), r = minDepth(root.right);
        int h = (l == 0 || r == 0)? l+r : Math.min(l,r);
        return h+1;
    }
}
```
