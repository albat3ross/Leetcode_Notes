# 101. Symmetric Tree ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Easy-green) 
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).  
For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric.  
But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:  
## Thoughts
Not much difference from #100, the previous one is checking for completely the same while this one is checking for partially the same. Just reverse the left and right on each layer of recursion.


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return true;
        return cmpr(root.left,root.right);
    }
    public boolean cmpr(TreeNode l, TreeNode r){
        if (l == null ^ r == null) return false;
        if (l == null && r == null) return true;
        if (l.val != r.val) return false;
        return cmpr(l.right,r.left) && cmpr(l.left,r.right);
    }
}
```
