# 120. Triangle ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.  
For example, given the following triangle
```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
```
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
Note:
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.
## Thoughts
1. Using O(n) extra space, first reaction is DFS, then I found that the efficency issue would not allow this kinds of method. So it's DP then.
2. Frist thought, start from top, as we went down records the shortest distance. Then I found it super hard to code, and we have to find minimum once we reach the bottom which is not elegant. Think twice and found that start from bottom should solve the problem with much less difficulty.
## Process of Solving
1. the list should be filled with the last row, each time we went up we count the shortest road result, at last the result will be at slot 0
2. Found that i+1 will cause OutofBound error, add 1 to the list.

## Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        int row = triangle.size();
        int[] pool = new int[row+1];
        for (int i = row-1; i>=0; i--){
            refresh(pool,triangle.get(i));
        }
        return pool[0];
    }
    public void refresh(int[] pool, List<Integer> level){
        int col = level.size();
        for (int i = 0; i< col; i++){
            pool[i] = level.get(i)+Math.min(pool[i],pool[i+1]);
        }
    }
}
```
