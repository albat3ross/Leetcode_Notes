# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.
Example 1:
```
Input: 1->2->3->3->4->4->5
Output: 1->2->5
```
## Thoughts
Easy question, not much to say.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        if (head.val != head.next.val) 
            head.next = deleteDuplicates(head.next);
        else {
            while(head.next!= null && head.val == head.next.val) head = head.next;
            head = deleteDuplicates(head.next);
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```
