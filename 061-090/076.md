# 76. Minimum Window Substring
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Example:
```
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```
Note:
- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

## Thoughts
Found a useful template for solving this problem, might take some time to figure out how to use it. But once you get it, you will find it SUPER useful. [Solution Link Here][link1]
>For most substring problem, we are given a string and need to find a substring of it which satisfy some restrictions. A general way is to use a hashmap assisted with two pointers.
Here is the solution implying this method.
## Solution
``` java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
    	int[] map = new int[128];      
    	int len = t.length();           
    	for (int i = 0; i< len;i++) {
    		map[t.charAt(i)]++;         
    	}
    	int begin = 0, end = 0, d = Integer.MAX_VALUE, h = 0;
    	while (end < s.length()) {
    		if (map[s.charAt(end++)]-->0) {
    			len--;
    		}
    		while (len == 0) {      
    			int neo_d = end-begin;
    			if (neo_d<d) {     
    				d = neo_d;
    				h = begin;
    			}
    			if (map[s.charAt(begin++)]++==0) len++;
    		}
    	}
    	String res = (d==Integer.MAX_VALUE)? "":s.substring(h, h+d);
    	
    	return res;
    }
}
```
