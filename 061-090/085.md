# 85. Maximal Rectangle ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```
## Thoughts
For some how the solution of last question can be magically used here!  
GOODBYE HARD PROBLEM!


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximalRectangle(char[][] matrix) {
        if (matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) return 0;
        int row =matrix.length, col = matrix[0].length;
        int res = 0;
        int[] heights = new int[col];
        for (int i = 0; i<row; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j<col; j++){
                heights[j] = (matrix[i][j]=='1')? heights[j]+1:0;
            }
            res = Math.max(largestRectangleArea(heights),res);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
