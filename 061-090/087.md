# 87. Scramble String ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Hard-red)
Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.  
Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great"
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.  
For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat". We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".  
Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae". We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".  
Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.  
## Thoughts
Recursive problem which should process from bottom up. The binary tree structure is relatively user-friendly. Just loop through all possible cut cases.


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
	public boolean isScramble(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.length() != s2.length())
			return false;
		if (s1.equals(s2))
			return true;
		int len = s1.length();
		int[] dic = new int[127];
		for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			dic[s1.charAt(i)]++;
			dic[s2.charAt(i)]--;
		}
		for (int i : dic) if (i!=0) return false;
        for (int i = 1; i<len;i++){
            if (isScramble(s1.substring(0,i),s2.substring(0,i)) && isScramble(s1.substring(i),s2.substring(i))) return true;
            if (isScramble(s1.substring(0,i),s2.substring(len-i)) && isScramble(s1.substring(i),s2.substring(0,len-i))) return true;
        }
        return false;
	}
}
```
