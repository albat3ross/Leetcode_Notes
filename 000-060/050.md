# 50. Pow(x, n) ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).  
Example 1:  
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

## Thoughts
Great warm up problem for people not touching LC for a year. The base logic is fairly easy. Implementing recursive function could solve the n power in log n times. However, later on we have negative n and edge cases, which needs to adjust the code for a bit.  
Did not optimize for the top logs, but still managed to be 100%+95%.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n < 0) {
            if (n == -2147483648){
                n = n/2;
                x = x*x;
            }else{
                n = -n;
                x = 1/x;
            }
        }
        return (n % 2) == 0 ? myPow(x*x, n/2): x*myPow(x*x, n/2);
    }
}
```
