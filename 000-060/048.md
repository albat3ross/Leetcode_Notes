# 48. Rotate Image ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
Example:  
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```
## Thoughts
Easy array tuning problem, you need to take some time figure out which cell goes to where. Better do it on paper to make sure it goes right.
Solution beats 100%/95%.
## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int len = matrix[0].length -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < (len + 1)/2; i++){
            for (int j = i; j < len - i; j++){
                int temp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[len-j][i];
                matrix[len-j][i] = matrix[len-i][len-j];
                matrix[len-i][len-j] =  matrix[j][len-i];
                matrix[j][len-i] = temp;
            }
        }

    }
}
```
