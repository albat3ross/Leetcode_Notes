# 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Medium-orange)
Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.  
The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.  
It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
Example 1:
```
Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2 
       /        
      5      

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).
```
## Thoughts
Very interesting question, a lot of useful method was used during solving this.

## Process of solving
1. recursively count the the width of Binary tree, for any root, the possible cases are:
    - end node of the largest width is at the same level of root
    - end node of the largest width is the root
    - end node of the largest width is at different level
2. We cannot simply use level^2 to count the width as the element might not be fully filled for each level, however we know that for every level the leftmost node is a fixed place, we can make a list to record them.
3. Hence we need to track: current node, the place of the node, and a list storing the start position for each level
4. Start coding. Note that for recursion, we have list.size()==level represents the index of the leftmost node for that level is not stored. As we know in inorder traversal we always access the leftmost node for every level, hence we can simply add current node to it.
5. The logic calculating the left and right max might have some space of improvement.


## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        return rec(root,0,1,list);
    }
    public int rec(TreeNode root, int level, int index, List<Integer> list){
        if (root == null) return 0;
        if (list.size() == level) list.add(index);
        int curr = index - list.get(level)+1;
        int left = rec(root.left, level+1,index*2,  list);
        int right= rec(root.right,level+1,index*2+1,list);
        return Math.max(curr,Math.max(left,right));
    }
}
```
